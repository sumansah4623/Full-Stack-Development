Now let’s learn MongoDB step-by-step using the terminal

start MongoDB
sudo systemctl start mongod

check status mongodb is running
sudo systemctl status mongod


Open MongoDB Shell
MongoDB works using a shell called mongosh.

Run:
mongosh


If successful, you’ll see something like:
Current Mongosh Log ID: ...
Connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/
>

That > means you are inside MongoDB 🎉

To exit anytime:
exit



Show existing databases
Inside mongosh, type:
show databases

You may see:
admin   40.00 KiB
config  60.00 KiB
local   72.00 KiB
