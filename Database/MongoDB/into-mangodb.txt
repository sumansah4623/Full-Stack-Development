MangoDB

MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database designed to store 
and manage large volumes of data efficiently using a flexible, JSON-like document model.

Stores data in BSON format for efficient handling of JSON-like documents.
Supports dynamic schemas, making it suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data.
Scalable and easy to learn, widely used in modern web and mobile applications.
Open-source and freely available on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

--> Reasons to Learn MongoDB

Developers use MongoDB because it offers a lot of features for those 
who like to work with big data. Here are few key reasons of why you should learn MongoDB.

1.Popular choice for modern web and real-time applications.
2.Provides scalability through sharding and high availability via replication.
3.Supports multiple programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Java.
4.Used by major companies like eBay, Uber, and Adobe for handling large, unstructured data.
5.Enables faster development with a flexible, schema-less data model.



--> MongoDB Hello World Example
The first step to start with MongoDB is to Insert a simple document into a database using MongoDB's Node.js driver. 
This example shows you have MongoDB installed and running locally.


// MongoDB Hello World Program
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
const client = new MongoClient(url);

async function run() {
    try {
        // Connect to the MongoDB server
        await client.connect();

        // Choose the database
        const db = client.db('testdb');

        // Choose the collection
        const collection = db.collection('users');

        // Insert a document
        const result = await collection.insertOne({ name: "John Doe", age: 30 });
        console.log(`Document inserted with _id: ${result.insertedId}`);
    } finally {
        // Close the connection
        await client.close();
    }
}

run().catch(console.error);




A simple MongoDB document Structure: 

{
  "_id": 1,
  "title": "Geeksforgeeks",
  "author": "John Smith",
  "url": "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/",
  "tags": ["NoSQL", "Database", "Tutorial"],
  "published": true,
  "views": 1500
}
_id: Unique identifier for the document.
title, author, url: Basic fields storing strings.
tags: An array of strings.
published: A Boolean value.
views: A number representing views or count.




Basic SQL Operations
MongoDB provides several basic operations to manage and manipulate data efficiently:

Create (Insert): Add new documents to a collection.
Read (Find): Retrieve documents from a collection based on query criteria.
Update: Modify existing documents in a collection.
Delete: Remove documents from a collection.



Features of the MongoDB database
MongoDB offers several key features that make it efficient and scalable:

Document Oriented: Stores all related data together in a single, flexible document rather than multiple tables.
Indexing: Enables fast queries by avoiding full collection scans, crucial for handling large data efficiently.
Scalability: Uses sharding to distribute data across multiple servers; easily add new machines to expand.
Replication and High Availability: Stores multiple data copies on different servers for redundancy and fault tolerance.
Aggregation: Processes and summarizes data (like SQL GROUP BY) using operations such as sum, avg, min, and max.
