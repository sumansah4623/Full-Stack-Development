Node.js is a powerful, open-source, and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine. 
It allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, making it ideal for building scalable server-side and networking applications.

JavaScript was mainly used for frontend development earlier. With Node.js (introduced in 2009), JavaScript became a backend language as well.
Non-blocking, event-driven architecture for high performance.
Supports the creation of REST APIs, real-time applications, and microservices.
Comes with a rich library of modules through npm (Node Package Manager).


To start with Node.js, you need to install and set it up on your machine. Follow these articles to install, depending on your system:

Let us now take a look at our first code example.


// Import the http module
const http = require("http");

// Create a server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain");
    res.end("Welcome to the Node.js Tutorial");
});

// Listen on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log(
        "Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
});
It will start a server, and when you visit http://localhost:3000, it will display

Welcome to the Node.js Tutorial
The http module is imported to create a basic HTTP server.
The createServer() method is used to handle incoming requests and send responses.
The server listens on port 3000, and a message is displayed in the browser when accessed.
