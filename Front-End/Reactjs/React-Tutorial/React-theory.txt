React is a powerful JavaScript library for building fast, scalable front-end applications. Created by Facebook, it's known for its component-based structure, single-page applications (SPAs), and virtual DOM,enabling efficient UI updates and a seamless user experience.



Why Learn React?
Before React, front-end development struggled with:

Manual DOM Manipulation: Traditional JavaScript directly modified the DOM, slowing down the performance.
Complex State Management: Maintaining UI state became messy and hard to debug.
Tight Coupling in Frameworks: Frameworks like Angular introduced complex two-way data binding that made code harder to manage.
React solved these issues with a modern and modular approach.

Core Features
Virtual DOM: React updates only the changed parts of the DOM, resulting in faster rendering.
One-Way Data Binding: Ensures predictable and easy to debug data flow.
Component-Based Architecture: Breaks UI into reusable pieces, improving the code reusability and scalability.
