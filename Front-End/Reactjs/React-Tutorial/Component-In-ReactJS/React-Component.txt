React Component

-Components are like functions that return HTML elements.
-Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

React components are reusable UI units that handle their own logic, accept data through props, manage state, and efficiently update only the parts of the UI that change.

User Action triggers an event (click, input, etc.).
setState / useState updates the component’s state.
React Component uses props, state, JSX, and event handlers to define UI logic.
State Update changes dynamic data inside the component.
Re-render is triggered for the affected component.
Updated UI is generated as a new Virtual DOM.
Diffing compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one.
Real DOM updates only the changed parts for better performance.


import React from 'react';

// Creating a simple functional component
function Greeting() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello, welcome to React!</h1>
  );
}

export default Greeting;
Output:

Hello, welcome to React!
Greeting is a React functional component.
It returns JSX: <h1>Hello, welcome to React!</h1>.
ReactDOM.render mounts it to the DOM at an element with id root.
function ComponentName() {
  return (
    <JSX />
  );
}





Types of React Components
There are two primary types of React components:

1. Functional Components
Functional components are JavaScript functions that return React elements and are the preferred way to build modern React applications.

Can manage state and lifecycle logic using React Hooks.
Use a simpler syntax, making them ideal for reusable components.
Offer better performance by avoiding the use of the this keyword.

function Greet(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}


2. Class Components
Class components are ES6 classes in React that extend React.Component and support state and lifecycle handling.

Manage component data using the this.state property.
Use lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.

class Greet extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}


3. Props in React Components
Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component. They enable dynamic data flow and reusability.

Props are immutable.
They enable communication between components.

function Greet(props) {
    return <h2>Welcome, {props.username}!</h2>;
}

// Usage
<Greet username="Adam" />;


4. State in React Components
State is a component-controlled JavaScript object used to store and manage dynamic data over time.

Updating state automatically triggers a re-render.
Functional components manage state using the useState hook.

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => 
                setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}


5. Rendering a Component
Rendering in React means displaying a component in the browser’s DOM.
Components must be imported before they can be rendered
ReactDOM.render() is typically used in the root file to mount the app
ReactDOM.render(<Greeting name="Emma" />, document.getElementById('root'));

6. Components in Components
In React, you can nest components inside other components to build a modular and hierarchical structure.

Components can be reused multiple times within the same or different components.
Props can be passed to nested components for dynamic content.

function Header() {
    return <h1>Welcome to My Site</h1>;
}

function Footer() {
    return <p>© 2024 My Company</p>;
}

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Header />
            <p>This is the main content.</p>
            <Footer />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
