React Hooks

Hooks allow functions to have access to state and other React features without using classes.

They provide a more direct API to React concepts like props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle.

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from functional components.

You must import Hooks from react.

Here we are using the useState Hook to keep track of the application state.

Hook Rules
There are 3 rules for hooks:

Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
Hooks cannot be conditional
