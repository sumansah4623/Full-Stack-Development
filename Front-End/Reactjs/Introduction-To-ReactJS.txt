Reactjs

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React is used to build single-page applications.

React allows us to create reusable UI components.

React is a front-end JavaScript library.

React was developed by the Facebook Software Engineer Jordan Walke.

React is also known as React.js or ReactJS.

React is a tool for building UI components.




-->How does React Work?
->React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
->Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
->React only changes what needs to be changed!





->>Setting Up a React Application on a Fresh System

This document provides a step-by-step guide to set up a React application on a newly installed system. You can copy-paste this directly into Notion and customize it as needed.


->System Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
✅ Operating System
- macOS / Linux / Windows 10+

✅ Node.js & npm
- Required Node.js version: v18.x or above
- npm comes bundled with Node.js


--> Diffing Algorithm 
Diffing Algorithm in React JS differentiates the updated and previous DOM of the application. DOM stores the components of a website in a tree structure. React uses virtual DOM which is a lightweight version of the DOM. The only difference is the ability to write the screen like the real DOM, in fact, a new virtual DOM is created after every re-render.


Why is the Diffing Algorithm Important?
Manipulating the DOM is one of the most performance-intensive operations in web development. Updating the entire DOM every time there’s a change would significantly slow down applications. The diffing algorithm ensures that only the minimum required updates are made, leading to:

Improved performance: By limiting DOM manipulations, the application runs faster.
Smooth user experience: Users experience fewer lags, even in dynamic applications.
Optimized rendering: React can handle frequent updates in real-time without performance bottlenecks.
How Diffing Algorithm Works?
First, the content is rendered on the webpage and the DOM tree is created.
On change in any content due to user interaction or change in data from API, React works on observable patterns, hence, whenever there is a change in the state, it updates the nodes in the virtual DOM
In reconciliation the old tree is compared to the newest version to determine the number of changes needed for updation.
After determining the changes a set of optimized and minimal instruction is created to implement on the real DOM.
These changes are then implemented and only content that changed is re-rendered on the web pages



Practical example
->Create a New React Application

You can create a React app using any of the following methods:
🅰️ Option 1: Create React App (CRA)
bash
run-> npx create-react-app my-app
run ->cd my-app
run ->npm start



Here are the exact commands for Vite + React 👇

🚀 Create Vite + React Project
npm create vite@latest my-app

When prompted, choose:
✔ Select a framework: React
✔ Select a variant: JavaScript
cd my-app
npm run dev
