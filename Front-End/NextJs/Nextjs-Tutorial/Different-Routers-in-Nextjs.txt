What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. 
You use React Components to build user interfaces, and 
Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

It also automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers. 
You can instead focus on building your product and shipping quickly.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, 
Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.




App Router and Pages Router
-->Next.js has two different routers:

App Router: The newer router that supports new React features like Server Components.
Pages Router: The original router, still supported and being improved.
At the top of the sidebar, you'll notice a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between the App Router and the Pages Router docs.

React version handling
The App Router and Pages Router handle React versions differently:

App Router: Uses React canary releases built-in, which include all the stable React 19 changes, as well as newer features being validated in frameworks, prior to a new React release.

Pages Router: Uses the React version installed in your project's package.json.

This approach ensures new React features work reliably in the App Router while maintaining backwards compatibility for existing Pages Router applications.




-->>App Router
The App Router is a file-system based router that uses React's latest features such as Server Components, Suspense, and Server Functions.
