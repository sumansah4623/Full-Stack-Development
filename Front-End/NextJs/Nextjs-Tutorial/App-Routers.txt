--->>Next JS 13 App Router

Routing refers to the process of determining how an application responds to a client request 
to a particular endpoint or URL. 
When a user clicks a link, enters a URL in the browser, or performs some action 
that changes the current URL, the routing mechanism decides which content or 
component to display on the page.


In this article, we will learn about Next.js 13 App router. 
Routing is an important concept in building single-page applications (SPAs) 
and dynamic web applications where navigating between pages updates the content 
on the page without a full reload, providing a smoother and more seamless user experience.



Next.js 13 App Router Usage
Next.js 13 App Router provides Hierarchical File Structure routing. 
which provides features such as shared layout, nested routing, loading states, error handling,
404 not found page, and many more.

Next.js 13 uses File System based routing in which App Router works in a /app directory. 
In this directory, Folders are used to define the route and nested route, 
and in that folders files such as page.js, error.js, layout.js,, and loading.js are used to create UI components.




page.js File & Nested Routing
A page.js is a component that contains a UI elements, 
which are displayed when you move to any route. Next.js 13 App Router automatically consider 
the page.js file when you move to any route and content of it is rendered on display. 
This file is not optional.

Nested Route is a route that is contained within another route. 
This allows you to create a hierarchy of routes, 
which can be useful for organizing your application's content.

For example, you have created a cloths folder in a app directory and 
inside that folder you have created a men and women folder and inside both the folder 
you have created a page.js component. So if you want to open men cloths section 
you can access it by using http://localhost:3000/cloths/men and if you want to open women 
cloths section you can access it by using http://localhost:3000/cloths/women and the content 
written inside page.js will be displayed.





Example:-
app/
 ├─ page.js        → http://localhost:3000
 ├─ about/page.js  → http://localhost:3000/about
 ├─ contact/page.js→ http://localhost:3000/contact


app/page.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}


✔ This is your Home page
✔ It loads at:

http://localhost:3000

2️⃣ Dev server running

Terminal shows:

Next.js 16.1.6
Ready
GET / 200


Means Next.js is running correctly

Next Step: Create MORE pages (practice)

You do NOT create random JS files.
You create folders inside app/.

🧩 Step 1: Create About page
Folder structure
app/
 ├─ page.js
 └─ about/
     └─ page.js

Code: app/about/page.js
export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <p>This is my second Next.js page.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

Open in browser
http://localhost:3000/about

🧩 Step 2: Create Contact page
app/
 └─ contact/
     └─ page.js

export default function Contact() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Contact Page</h1>
      <p>Learning Next.js 🚀</p>
    </div>
  );
}


URL:

http://localhost:3000/contact

🔗 Step 3: Add navigation (VERY IMPORTANT)

Update home page:

app/page.js
import Link from "next/link";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home Page</h1>

      <ul>
        <li><Link href="/about">About</Link></li>
        <li><Link href="/contact">Contact</Link></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
