Next.js Routing


Routing in Next.js is a built-in, file-based system that automatically maps URLs to files and folders, making navigation simple, fast, and efficient without extra libraries.

Uses file-based routing via the pages/ or app/ directory with no extra setup.
Supports dynamic and nested routes through folder and file naming.
Provides fast navigation using the built-in Link component with preloading.
Allows redirects, SEO-friendly URLs, and optimized performance by default.
Types of Routes in Next.js
Next.js provides a powerful file-based routing system that supports static, dynamic, nested, and API routes. This makes navigation easy to implement without relying on external libraries.

1. Static Routes
A static route in Next.js is created by adding a file with a fixed name inside the pages/ or app/ directory, which automatically maps to a URL.

Example: We create a file in the pages directory named index.js.

// pages/index.js

const Home = () => { 
    return(
        <div>
            Home Page
        </div>
    );
}
export default Home;
It could be accessed by going to http://localhost:3000/

2. Nested Routes
A nested route in Next.js is created by placing a file inside a subfolder, which maps to a hierarchical URL path automatically.

Example: Create a new folder named users and add a file called about.js inside it.

// pages/user/about.js

const About = () => { 
    return(
        <div>
            About Page
        </div>
    );
}
export default About;
We can access this file by visiting http://localhost:3000/users/about.

3. Dynamic Routes
Dynamic Routes in Next.js allow you to create routes with variable path segments by using square brackets (e.g., [id].js), enabling pages to render dynamically based on the URL.

Example: Creating a file named [id].js inside the pages directory.

// pages/users/[id].js

import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const User= () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;

  return <p>User: {id}</p>;
};

export default User;
It allows the component to access the dynamic id parameter and render content accordingly by visiting localhost:3000/<any-id>.

4. API Routes
API Routes in Next.js allow you to build backend endpoints inside the application by creating files in the pages/api directory, enabling server-side logic without a separate backend.

// Filename : pages/api/hello.js

export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, world!' });
}
Advanced Routing
Advanced routing in Next.js includes features like catch-all routes, optional catch-all routes, nested layouts, parallel routes, and intercepting routes (in Next.js 13+). These features give developers more flexibility and control over complex navigation flows.

5. Catch-All Routes
We can catch all paths in Next.js using catch-all routes. For this, we have to add three dots inside the square brackets in the name of the file as shown below:

./pages/[...file_name].js
6. Optional Catch-All Routes
Optional catch-all routes in Next.js handle URLs with zero or more dynamic path segments.

Created using double square brackets with three dots: [[...slug]].js
Match multiple route patterns, including the base path with no segments.
Example:

./pages/[[...file_name]].js
