Agile Methodology is a way to manage projects by breaking them into smaller parts. It focuses on working together and making constant improvements. Teams plan, work on the project, and then review how things are going in a repeating cycle.

It focuses on delivering smaller pieces of work regularly instead of one big launch.
This allows teams to adapt to changes quickly and provide customer value faster.
Major companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon use Agile because of its adaptability and customer-focused approach.
Prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction.

Key Principles of Agile Methodology
The Agile Manifesto defines 12 principles that guide flexible and efficient software development. They focus on collaboration, frequent delivery, embracing change, continuous improvement, and delivering maximum value with technical excellence.

The Alliance defines 12 Agile lightness principles for those who need to attain agility:

Our highest priority is to satisfy the client through early and continuous delivery of valuable computer software.
Agile processes welcome changing requirements, even late in development, and leverage change to provide a competitive advantage for the customer.
Deliver operating computer software often, from a pair of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
Business individuals and developers should work together daily throughout the project.
The build comes around to activate people. offer them the setting and support they have, and trust them to complete the task.
The foremost economical and effective methodology of conveying information to and among a development team is face-to-face speech.
Working with computer software is the primary life of progress.
Agile processes promote property development. The sponsors, developers, and users will be able to maintain a relentless pace indefinitely.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and smart style enhances nimbleness.
Simplicity—the art of maximizing the number of work not done—is essential.
The most effective architectures, necessities, and styles emerge from self–organizing groups.
At regular intervals, the team reflects on a way to become simpler, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.



Agile Development Stages
The Agile (SDLC) breaks a project into six structured stages, enabling continuous improvement, faster delivery, and better adaptability to change.

Agile Development Stages
1. Requirement Gathering
In this stage, the project team identifies and documents the needs and expectations of various stakeholders, including clients, users, and subject matter experts.
It involves defining the Project's Scope, objectives, and requirements.
Establishing a budget and schedule.
Creating a project plan and allocating resources.
2. Design
Developing a high-level system architecture.
Creating detailed specifications, which include data structures, algorithms, and interfaces.
Planning for the software's user interface.
3. Development (Coding)
Writing the actual code for the software.
Conducting unit testing to verify the functionality of individual components.
4. Testing
This phase involves several types of testing:

Integration Testing: Ensuring that different components work together.
System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.
User Acceptance Testing: Confirming that the software meets user requirements.
Performance Testing: Assessing the system's speed, scalability, and stability.
5. Deployment
Deploying the software to a production environment.
Put the software into the real world where people can use it.
Make sure it works smoothly in the real world.
Providing training and support for end-users.
6. Review (Maintenance)
Addressing and resolving any issues that may arise after deployment.
Releasing updates and patches to enhance the software and address problems.
